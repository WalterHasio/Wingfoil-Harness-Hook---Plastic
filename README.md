# Wingfoil-Harness-Hook---Plastic
Wing foil harness hook designed for 2in and 1.5in webbing.  This hook is designed to be printed in a hard plastic (PETG, Nylon, etc).  I used the 2in version a couple of times, but was concerned the hard plastic hook may damage my board and ended up designing one to be printed in TPU.
