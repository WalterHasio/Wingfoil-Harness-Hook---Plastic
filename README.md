Wing foil harness hook designed for 2in and 1.5in webbing.  This hook is designed to be printed in a hard plastic (PETG, Nylon, etc).  I used the 2in version a couple of times, but was concerned the hard plastic hook may damage my board and ended up designing one to be printed in TPU.

Plastic hooks are a common option though so some might find this design preferable.  It does unhook easier than the TPU version.  I have not printed or tested the 1.5in version.
